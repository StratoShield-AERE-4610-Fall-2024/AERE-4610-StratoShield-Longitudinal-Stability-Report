\chapter{Introduction}\label{cp:introduction}

This report presents the analysis of the longitudinal stability of our aircraft based on the \acrfull{cg} static margin calculations and present design iteration. The objective is to assess the stability characteristics, determine if the static margin is within acceptable limits, and propose potential modifications to improve the aircraft's performance in \acrfull{slf}.

Important aspects of the analysis include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Determining the angle of attack required for \acrshort{slf}, supported by lift vs. \acrfull{aoa} plot.
    \item Evaluate the center pitching moment across various \acrshort{aoa}, focusing on determining the \acrshort{aoa} necessary for cruising conditions.
    \item Reviewing the aircraft's \acrshort{cg} and \acrfull{np} through a side view diagram to visualize the relative positions that influence stability.
    \item Assessing the tail sizing coefficients for this design iteration and determining whether they are appropriately sized for optimal stability and control.
\end{itemize}

The report provides an in-depth evaluation of the aircraft's static margin and pitching moment characteristics, followed by recommendations for design adjustments based on the results. Additionally, we outline possible changes the team may consider to improve the aircraft's stability and performance in future iterations.
