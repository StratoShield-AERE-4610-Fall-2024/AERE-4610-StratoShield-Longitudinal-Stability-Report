\chapter{Conclusion}\label{cp:conclusion}

In this report, we analyzed the static margin, pitching moments, and tail sizing coefficients as they relate to the longitudinal stability of our aircraft.

Currently, the static margin is approximately \qty{31.42}{\percent}â€”above the ideal range. This indicates excessive stability, which could cause poor control response. For the tail sizing coefficients, the values we assumed for \gls{C_HT} and \gls{C_VT} are relatively small and they are subject to change in the future. Lastly, the pitching moment is currently too high at our desired angle of attack of \qty{-2.85}{\degree}.

For our future iterations, we will make adjustments to the wing and tail configurations to reduce the static margin. We also need to test the possibility of changing the airfoil shape due to manufacturability and to address the pitching moment. We will refine our \acrshort{cg} position to perform more accurate aerodynamic and structural analyses.

This report concludes our first official design iteration. Following this initial design, we will refine our system requirements to create a formal system requirement scorecard that we will use to grade each subsequent design iteration until we have arrived at a suitable design.
